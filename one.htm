		The Story of Bonnie and Clyde<br>

		<p>You´ve heard the story of Jesse James
		Of how he lived and died
		If you´re still in need
		Of something to read
		Here´s the story of Bonnie and Clyde...</p>

		<p>Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang
		I´m sure you all have read
		How they rob and steal
		And those who squeal
		Are usually found dyin´ or dead.</p>

		<p>They call them cold-hearted killers
		They say they are heartless and mean
		But I say this with pride
		That I once knew Clyde
		When he was honest and upright and clean.</p>

		<p>But ´laws´ fooled around
		Kept takin´ him down
		And lockin´ him up in a cell
		Till he said to me: ´I´ll never be free
		So I´ll meet a few of them in Hell.´</p>

		<p>If a policeman is killed in Dallas
		And they have no clue to guide
		If they can´t find a fiend
		They just wipe their slate clean
		And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.</p>

		<p>If they try to act like citizens
		And rent them a nice little flat
		About the third night
		They´re invited to fight
		By a sub-guns´ rat-a-tat-tat.</p>

		<p>Some day, they´ll go down together
		They´ll bury them side by side
		To a few, it´ll be grief-
		To the law, a relief-
		But it´s death for Bonnie and Clyde.</p>
