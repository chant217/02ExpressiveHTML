        <p id="title">The Story of Bonnie and Clyde</p>

                <p id="poem1">You´ve heard the story of Jesse James <br>
                Of how he lived and died <br>
                If you´re still in need <br>
                Of something to read <br>
                <p id="poem2">Here´s the story of Bonnie and Clyde...</p>

                <p id="poem3">Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang <br>
                I´m sure you all have read <br>
                How they rob and steal <br>
                And those who squeal <br>
                Are usually found dyin´ or dead <br>

                They call them cold-hearted killers <br>
                They say they are heartless and mean <br>
                But I say this with pride <br>
                That I once knew Clyde <br>
                When he was honest and upright and clean <br>

                But ´laws´ fooled around <br>
                Kept takin´ him down <br>
                And lockin´ him up in a cell <br>
                Till he said to me: ´I´ll never be free <br>
                So I´ll meet a few of them in Hell. <br>

                If a policeman is killed in Dallas <br>
                And they have no clue to guide <br>
                If they can´t find a fiend <br>
                They just wipe their slate clean <br>
                And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde. <br>

                If they try to act like citizens <br>
                And rent them a nice little flat <br>
                About the third night <br>
                They´re invited to fight <br>
                By a sub-guns´ rat-a-tat-tat <br>

                Some day, they´ll go down together <br>
                They´ll bury them side by side <br>
                To a few, it´ll be grief- <br>
                To the law, a relief- <br>
                But it´s death for Bonnie and Clyde <br> </p>
