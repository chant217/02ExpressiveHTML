            Now <br>

            the <br> 
            Barrow <br> 
            gang <br> 
        

            I´m <br>

            all <br>
            have <br>
            read <br>
            

            How <br>
            they <br>
            rob <br>
            and <br>
            steal <br>
            

            And <br>
            those <br>
            who <br>
            squeal <br>
            

            
            Are <br>

            found <br>
            dyin´ <br>
            or <br>
            dead. <br>
            

            They <br>
            call <br>
            them <br>
            cold-hearted <br>
            killers <br>
            

            
            They <br>
            say <br>
            they <br>
            are <br>
            heartless <br>
            and <br>
            mean <br>
            

            
            But <br>
            I <br>
            say <br>
            this <br>
            with <br>
            pride <br>
        

            
            That <br>
            I <br>
            once <br>
            knew <br>
            Clyde <br>
            

            
            When <br>
            he <br>
            was <br>
            honest <br>
            and <br>
            upright <br>
            and <br>
            clean. <br>
            

            
            But <br>
            ´laws´ <br>
            fooled <br>
            around <br>
            
            
            
            Kept <br>

            And <br>
            lockin´ <br>
            him <br>
            up <br>
            in <br>
            a <br>
            cell <br>
            
            
            
            Till <br>
            he <br>
            said <br>

            me: <br>
            ´I´ll <br>
            never <br>

            free <br>
            
            
        
            So <br>
            I´ll <br>
            meet <br>
