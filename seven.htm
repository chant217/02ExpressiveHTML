            <h3>The Story of Bonnie and Clyde </h3>
        </p>

        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                You´ve heard the story of Jesse James<br>
                Of how he lived and died<br>
                If you´re still in need<br>
                Of something to read<br>
                Here´s the story of Bonnie and Clyde...<br>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang<br>
                I´m sure you all have read<br>
                How they rob and steal<br>
                And those who squeal<br>
                Are usually found dyin´ or dead.<br>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                They call them cold-hearted killers<br>
                They say they are heartless and mean<br>
                But I say this with pride<br>
                That I once knew Clyde<br>
                When he was honest and upright and clean.<br>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                But ´laws´ fooled around<br>
                Kept takin´ him down<br>
                And lockin´ him up in a cell<br>
                Till he said to me: ´I´ll never be free<br>
                So I´ll meet a few of them in Hell.´<br>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                If a policeman is killed in Dallas<br>
                And they have no clue to guide<br>
                If they can´t find a fiend<br>
                They just wipe their slate clean<br>
                And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.<br>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                If they try to act like citizens<br>
                And rent them a nice little flat<br>
                About the third night<br>
                They´re invited to fight<br>
                By a sub-guns´ rat-a-tat-tat.<br>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                Some day, they´ll go down together<br>
                They´ll bury them side by side<br>
                To a few, it´ll be grief-<br>
                To the law, a relief-<br>
                But it´s death for Bonnie and Clyde.<br>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
