            The Story of Bonnie and Clyde
        </p>

            <p> You´ve heard the story of Jesse James</p>
            <p> Of how he lived and died </p>
            <p> If you´re still in need </p>
            <p> Of something to read </p>
            <p> Here´s the story of Bonnie and Clyde... </p>

            <p> Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang </p>
            <p> I´m sure you all have read </p>
            <p> How they rob and steal </p>
            <p> And those who squeal </p>
            <p> Are usually found dyin´ or dead. </p>

            <p> They call them cold-hearted killers </p>
            <p> They say they are heartless and mean </p>
            <p> But I say this with pride </p>
            <p> That I once knew Clyde </p>
            <p> When he was honest and upright and clean. </p>

            <p> But ´laws´ fooled around </p>
            <p> Kept takin´ him down </p>
            <p> And lockin´ him up in a cell </p>
            <p> Till he said to me: ´I´ll never be free </p>
            <p> So I´ll meet a few of them in Hell.´ </p>

            <p> If a policeman is killed in Dallas </p>
            <p> And they have no clue to guide </p>
            <p> If they can´t find a fiend </p>
            <p> They just wipe their slate clean </p>
            <p> And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde. </p>

            <p> If they try to act like citizens </p>
            <p> And rent them a nice little flat </p>
            <p> About the third night </p>
            <p> They´re invited to fight </p>
            <p> By a sub-guns´ rat-a-tat-tat. </p>

            <p> Some day, they´ll go down together </p>
            <p> They´ll bury them side by side </p>
            <p> To a few, it´ll be grief- </p>
            <p> To the law, a relief- </p>
            <p> But it´s death for Bonnie and Clyde. </p>
