            <h1>The Story of Bonnie and Clyde</h1>
        </p>

        <p>
            You´ve heard the story of Jesse James<br>
            Of how he lived and died<br>
            If you´re still in need<br>
            Of something to read<br>
            Here´s the story of Bonnie and Clyde...<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang<br>
            I´m sure you all have read<br>
            How they rob and steal<br>
            And those who squeal<br>
            Are usually found dyin´ or dead.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            They call them cold-hearted killers<br>
            They say they are heartless and mean<br>
            But I say this with pride<br>
            That I once knew Clyde<br>
            When he was honest and upright and clean.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            But ´laws´ fooled around<br>
            Kept takin´ him down<br>
            And lockin´ him up in a cell<br>
            Till he said to me: ´I´ll never be free<br>
            So I´ll meet a few of them in Hell.´<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            If a policeman is killed in Dallas<br>
            And they have no clue to guide<br>
            If they can´t find a fiend<br>
            They just wipe their slate clean<br>
            And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            If they try to act like citizens<br>
            And rent them a nice little flat<br>
            About the third night<br>
            They´re invited to fight<br>
            By a sub-guns´ rat-a-tat-tat.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Some day, they´ll go down together<br>
            They´ll bury them side by side<br>
            To a few, it´ll be grief-<br>
            To the law, a relief-<br>
            But it´s death for Bonnie and Clyde.<br>
        </p>
