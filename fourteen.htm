        <h1>The Story of Bonnie and Clyde</h1>

            <p>You´ve heard the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_James">Jesse James</a><b id="slash">/</b> Of how he lived and died<b id="slash">/</b> If you´re still in need<b id="slash">/</b> Of something to read<b id="slash">/</b> Here´s the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde">Bonnie and Clyde</a>...</p>

            <p>Now Bonnie and Clyde are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrow_Gang">the Barrow gang</a><b id="slash">/</b>
            I´m sure you all have read<b id="slash">/</b>
            How they rob and steal<b id="slash">/</b>
            And those who squeal<b id="slash">/</b>
            Are usually found dyin´ or dead.</p>

            <p>They call them cold-hearted killers<b id="slash">/</b>
            They say they are heartless and mean<b id="slash">/</b>
            But I say this with pride<b id="slash">/</b>
            That I once knew Clyde<b id="slash">/</b>
            When he was honest and upright and clean.</p>

            <p>But ´laws´ fooled around<b id="slash">/</b>
            Kept takin´ him down<b id="slash">/</b>
            And lockin´ him up in a cell<b id="slash">/</b>
            Till he said to me: ´I´ll never be free<b id="slash">/</b>
            So I´ll meet a few of them in Hell.´</p>

            <p>If a policeman is killed in Dallas<b id="slash">/</b>
            And they have no clue to guide<b id="slash">/</b>
            If they can´t find a fiend<b id="slash">/</b>
            They just wipe their slate clean<b id="slash">/</b>
            And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.</p>

            <p>If they try to act like citizens<b id="slash">/</b>
            And rent them a nice little flat<b id="slash">/</b>
            About the third night<b id="slash">/</b>
            They´re invited to fight<b id="slash">/</b>
            By a sub-guns´ rat-a-tat-tat.</p>

            <p>Some day, they´ll go down together<b id="slash">/</b>
            They´ll bury them side by side<b id="slash">/</b>
            To a few, it´ll be grief-<b id="slash">/</b>
            To the law, a relief-<b id="slash">/</b>
            But it´s death for Bonnie and Clyde.</p>
