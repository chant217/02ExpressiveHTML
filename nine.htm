            <strong>The Story of Bonnie and Clyde</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            You´ve heard the story of Jesse James<br>
            Of how he lived and <strong>died</strong><br>
            If you´re still in <strong><em>need</em></strong><br>
            Of something to <strong><em>read</em></strong><br>
            Here´s the story of Bonnie and <strong>Clyde</strong>...<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang<br>
            I´m sure you all have <strong>read</strong><br>
            How they rob and <strong><em>steal</em></strong><br>
            And those who <strong><em>squeal</em></strong><br>
            Are usually found dyin´ or <strong>dead</strong>.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            They call them cold-hearted killers<br>
            They say they are heartless and <strong>mean</strong><br>
            But I say this with <strong><em>pride</em></strong><br>
            That I once knew <strong><em>Clyde</em></strong><br>
            When he was honest and upright and <strong>clean</strong>.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            But ´laws´ fooled <strong><em>around</em></strong><br>
            Kept takin´ him <strong><em>down</em></strong><br>
            And lockin´ him up in a <strong>cell</strong><br>
            Till he said to me: ´I´ll never be free<br>
            So I´ll meet a few of them in <strong>Hell</strong>.´<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            If a policeman is killed in Dallas<br>
            And they have no clue to <strong>guide</strong><br>
            If they can´t find a <strong><em>fiend</em></strong><br>
            They just wipe their slate <strong><em>clean</em></strong><br>
            And hang it on Bonnie and <strong>Clyde</strong>.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            If they try to act like citizens<br>
            And rent them a nice little <strong>flat</strong><br>
            About the third <strong><em>night</em></strong><br>
            They´re invited to <strong><em>fight</em></strong><br>
            By a sub-guns´ <strong>rat-a-tat-tat</strong>.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Some day, they´ll go down together<br>
            They´ll bury them side by <strong>side</strong><br>
            To a few, it´ll be <strong><em>grief</em></strong>-<br>
            To the law, a <strong><em>relief</em></strong>-<br>
            But it´s death for Bonnie and <strong>Clyde</strong>.<br>
        </p>
